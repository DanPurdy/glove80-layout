# QWERTY Simple Programmer OSX layout EN-GB

en-GB mac layout based off the default glove 80 mac layout. Testing the use of a symbol layer and a macro to see how they work.

symbol layer originally based on the article at [getreuer.info](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html) v2 adds some tweaks ti test but needs some extra work due to being a en-gb layout.

## Changelog

v2.2
- moved the numbers layter trigger to a layer tap on the `enter` key on layer 0 RH side
- added all function keys to the numbers layer
- Removed the arrow keys from the default layer to prevent accidental use, my fat fingers kept moving me around in the text, intention to use vim bindings for arrow keys in the future
- added `;` to the rh pinky home row on the symbols layer as id overlooked it previously
- moved the `#` key on the symbols layer to the bottom row right hand index finger;
- changed the default &lt tap timeout to 300ms from the default 200ms as i was occasionally hanging too long on the space button

v2.0
- added a numbers layer
  - switched tab and escape keys around on the default layer for easier reach
