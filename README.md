# QWERTY Simple Programmer OSX layout EN-GB

en-GB mac layout based off the default glove 80 mac layout. Testing the use of a symbol layer and a macro to see how they work.

symbol layer based from the article at [getreuer.info](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html) needs some extra work due to being a en-gb layout.
